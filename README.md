# fretwork
Shared code for FoFiX and FoF:R 

The goal of this project is to reduce the duplication of effort around developing 2 differant forks of Frets on Fire. In general the code moved into this repository will be cleaned up from either FoFiX or enhanced from FoF:R. Then each project will be changed to remove the old code use the version located here.
